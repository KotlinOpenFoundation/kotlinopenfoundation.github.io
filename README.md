# Welcome to the Kotlin Open Foundation!

The Kotlin Open Foundation is a community-driven organization dedicated to fostering 
a vibrant open-source ecosystem for the Kotlin programming language. We aim to:

  and expand the language's capabilities. 
- **Promote collaboration and innovation:**
  We believe in open collaboration and encourage developers to contribute their ideas and expertise to our projects.
- **Support the Kotlin community:**
  We'll provide educational resources, documentation, and events to help developers of all levels learn,
  and grow with Kotlin.
